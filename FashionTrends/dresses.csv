I wanted to find a product that would restore my strands and have them looking their absolute best this summer, so I decided to try Hair Food. Hair Food is inspired by super foods and their new Color Protect Collection doesn't contain any sulfates or parabens so I knew right away that it was for me. I've been using the conditioner weekly and I always leave it in my hair for a few hours while I work on the computer. This allows the conditioner to really penetrate my strands and gives me longer lasting softness, something that my hair is in desperate need of since we live in such a dry climate. Once I became hooked on the Shampoo & Conditioner I decided to give their dry shampoo a try - It smells delicious, blends into my hair quickly and gives my mane a little extra bounce when it's looking limp between washes.""",b'turquoise blue:Adelyn Rae dress;'

If you ever plan to visit southern California, you should definitely check it out.

The days are filled with fashion, strolling the cobblestone streets of Paris and catching up with some of my favorite blogger girls. In order to get all over town (for work and play!) looking chic I rely on great accessories. For today's looks, I styled my floral Just Fab blazer and pink bag two different ways. For the first look, I wanted something casual and comfortable for touring around Montmartre after a busy day of shows, so I styled a pink suede dress with pink sneakers and a matching bag for a look that was monochromatic yet visually interesting. For my second look, I wanted to style my denim for a casual afternoon meeting, so I paired it with blue almond-toed pumps, a burnt orange blouse and simple gold accessories. Styling things multiple ways is the perfect way to save room and avoid overweigh baggage fees when traveling! Do you ever do this on trips?""",b'light pink:JustFab shoes;'

You know, I always try to stay super creative and make my blog to stand out. But blogging and creating takes a lot of time and energy, and requires finding inspiration. I would love to share with you a few tips for how can you set up an editorial photo shoot. Think of the concept. I always looked up what I wanted via Pinterest or Instagram. I'm not looking so much for bloggers' pictures, but more looking at what models/ photographers have done. Think of the location. Location is usually a really important aspect for your photoshoot. Of course, outdoors is always best not just for cool places, but also for the photography reasons if you don't have a photography skills (shooting in daylight and outside is easiest).Think of the outfit. The outfit can create not only a strong image but also tell the story of your concept.Hair/ Make Up Style. I barely think of these things because I'm bad at styling my hair and my face. But if you work with professionals, make sure to tell them what you are looking for.Editing Skills.

But then one day while I was scrolling on ebay I spotted this gorgeous Dolce & Gabbana bag - brand new with tags! The bag was still on the D&G website at the time for over $2,500 but for something that is this trendy, I would never pay that. So when I saw it on ebay with the bid starting at $1,200 I thought, hmmm, interesting. I put it on my watch list to see what it would go for but when the bidding ended, and nobody had made an offer, I knew that it was my chance to make a move. I contacted the seller and offered her $800 plus shipping and she countered at $850! Insert happy dance here! While I know I was supposed to be saving (I'll start tomorrow, promise!) this was just wayyy too good of a deal to pass up. I took the bag to a re-sale shop to have it appraised and they certified that it is authentic. What a steal of a deal! I go totally weak in the knees for sparkles and this little box bag was just what I needed to make my heart incredibly happy. I paired it with a faux fur capelet and a little pink skirt for a look that was perfect for a breakfast date. This was my first handbag purchase on ebay but certainly won't be my last.""",b'white:gianvitto rossi shoes;'

Head turning outfits aren\'t the only thing that will make people stop and stare, your makeup is just as important! Especially when you\'re heading out to fabulous f\xc3\xaates. I used Rimmel London\'s ""Get The Look"" app to get me party ready. A few days before the party, I uploaded inspirational makeup looks that I found in magazines and on the web and tried them on myself with ease! All I had to do was take a selfie. It was quick and easy to see which makeup trends were hot and which were not. As much as I love to play with new looks, maybe bright blue eyeshadow just isn\'t for me.'",b':B Brian Atwood shoes;'

Because boots can make or break any outfit and the right pair, can get you through fall and winter in style. For today's post, I'm partnering with Clarks & Zappos to share one of my new favorite pairs! I love this style because the cognac color is so versatile. You can pair them with black, brown and every color in between. I also love this style because the heel isn't sky high, so it makes them perfect for weekend strolling or even hours of holiday shopping. Zappos made finding these boots a breeze!

In today's look, I paired a snake print INC International Concepts trench with a burgundy tunic and a matching burgundy statement necklace. Comfortable dresses are always a go-to for me and styles with elegant details like buttons and lace are even more appealing. This look could easily be dressed down with tights and black booties, but I decided to keep things polished by adding sleek pointed toed pumps and a suede crossbody bag -- perfect for a day of meetings in Manhattan.

Sure it's easy to drop a nice note on someones Facebook wall, or even to send a tried and true e-card, but there's nothing like knowing that someone took the time to hand select a special card for you and then sealed the envelope, slapped a stamp on it and put it in the mail.

You know I have been extremely busy with Fashion Week and my travels. My blogger friend, Elyse (check her blog Faith In Style), and I decided to take a trip to NYC.After a long flight and having a big dinner in one of newest restaurants in K town, we went straight to the Empire State Building. The next morning, we planned a photoshoot for IFBK Seoul. It was quite an adventure to get all the people in one location, but we finally did. We tried to stay as active as possible by running to fashion shows, meeting with bloggers and other cool people, shooting outfits, doing some sightseeing, and even finding time to snack or grab a coffee along the way. Here is a shoot of the outfit that I wore on the first night. I'm wearing a beautiful lace dress from Storets. The color green is going to be trendy this season. """,b'teal:storets dress;'
