This time of the year is perfect to go through the day and kick it around town in a blazer and some classic oxford shoes. I am wearing an unconstructed herringbone pattern blazer, dark denim, and a brown earthy tone messenger bag. I added a bandana as a cool trendy european vibe accessory. It adds in just enough subtle details to tie in the whole outfit together. Now on to the shoes, I\xe2\x80\x99m really loving these new oxford shoes with an updated modern toe by Nisolo.'",b'brown:Nisolo shoes;'

Chances are you already have some of these essential items in your closet - white dress shirt, white chino pants, beige linen jacket, and suede loafers. I went with a casual approach with an oxford button-down shirt and worn it untucked (helps with some air flow in the season too!). Paired the look with a clean and sharp pair of white chinos to break up the ensemble. Finished off with some suede tassel loafers that look great dressed up or down.

Time is really flying by this summer! Here's a look back on my street style outfit from Day 1. I've been really inspired by the latest fashion trend of Sourvenir jackets especially after visiting Japan back in March. I finally got my hands on this Marc Jacobs Tiger Emboridered Coach Jacket after searching for a while. I love this jacket because of the amazing quality and details. The jacket is minimal overall with a Roaring Tiger design on the back. It was definitely an eye-catcher on the streets of fashion week. Sharp, subtle, yet flashy is usually a hard balancing act to achieve. I paired the jacket with a good mix of menswear pieces and street style items. I went with a classic summer denim shirt as a base layer while matching some of the details on the Tiger. The black jeans keeps the outfit uniformed and focused. I took the jeans for some scissor action for the ripped knee and tapered bottom. Finally keeping it a good mix of high and low - I went with a pair of white dress shoes by Todd Snyder x Cole Haan. Thankfully the heat on the first day was under control and I was about to rock this awesome jacket in the summer. This won't be the last time you'll see this jacket, that's for sure!""",b'ivory:Todd Snyder x Cole Haan shoes;'

The lightweight blazer and suit pants is a go-to smart casual combination for the summer. Suit-separate pieces are great to break them apart and wear it casually this way. The navy blue jacket and beige/white pants are staples that always work well together. Opt for a nice fitted polo to dress it up a bit instead of a regular t-shirt. Feel free to tuck it in or leave it out depending on the occasion. Complete the look with a pair of sophisticated suede loafers.',b'light brown:Allen Edmonds shoes;'

A cotton suit is a great option to have for the summer because the material is lighter and breathable. It doubles as office style and a wedding suit so can't really beat that type of versatility in menswear! I love the beige or light grey color options since it's subtle for the office and goes with my skin color better. I went with a striped knit tie and gingham pocket square for a little pattern mix combo. Extra tip: Unbutton the shirt sleeve for more air circulation to cool you off. The overall look is kept minimal, sharp and clean - exactly the blueprint for summer style.""",b'gray:Allen Edmonds shoes;'

But I also wanted to be casual and comfortable since I was doing some sightseeing and spending time with family so I paired the jacket with some casual pieces. I went with complementing items like the striped shirt, white jeans, and leather sneakers. The whole look is put together with a mix of formal and casual in monochromatic fashion.

This set was shot by Katherine for the style collaboration with a local boho-inspired boutique in Capitol Hill called Fox + the Feather. It was our 3rd styling looks (Here is First & Second ), and I really wanted to create something so comfy and casual - like road trip outfit to Cali or Miami! I totally adore the ""gypsy rocker chic"" vibe, and I am obsessed with the Mate the Label\'s classic tank with rad prints! I styled it with Free People white lace halter bra underneath, and Sub Urban Riot flannel button shirt & white chunky cardigan for extra layers (because guys... it was bloody freezing! ) That way, it gives multiple options to change the look 1) Tank + flannel shirt + chunky cardigan, 2) Tank + flannel shirt without cardigan, 3) Tank + flannel shirt tied around waist and wear cardigan, and 4) Tank + flannel shirt tied around waist without cardigan. I always so into that one look can be transformed into various looks! When you go for a gypsy-inspired look, you can\'t really forget to stack accessories!!! Especially you can\'t avoid from wearing anything with turquoise and silvers!! I was so impressed by how much Fox + the Feather carries amazing accessories from shoes to belt to rings! One of the jewelry brands I happened to be fond of so much from them is Jay Nicole Jewelry.

Except for shorts, of course.\xc2\xa0It is so rare for me to wear pants that I only own 2 pairs of jeans and a pair of plaid trousers. Nevertheless, I hardly ever go out wearing them as skirts and dresses are much more comfortable than any pair of pants could ever be. I don\'t have to mention my passion for patterns and printed pants tend to be rather difficult to wear for there is always a chance to end up looking fatter, hahaa. So, I rarely wear pants but when I do, plain fabric is the best choise for me. There was a time, not long ago, when I was interested in buying a pair of dark green pants or maybe a pair of burnt orange jeans would have been nice too but then I thought to myself ""What about some skirts instead?"" Well, that was the end of my interest in shopping for jeans.'",b''

Case and point this wonderful fuchsia jacket. I spotted this beauty online at J Crew and I looked at it about 20 times.
