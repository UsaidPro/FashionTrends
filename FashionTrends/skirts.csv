I hope this is my last winter-themed outfit, since I'm back in Cali. This year is going to be quite adventurous for me and my husband. I have big plans for where I want to travel this year. First, I found some bargain plane tickets to San Diego and Seattle. If I get the chance, I'd love to go back to NYC. Also, I want to go to Los Angeles because we were not able to see so much of the city last time. I would also like to see the Grand Canyon and Napa Valley. In May, we plan to move to another country. I'm going to keep it secret because I want you guys to stay tuned. But I want to see some European cities and countries, and maybe Central Asia. After launching DISPURS, I really need to get back to Korea. I sound probably crazy, but I want to do certain things before I turn 30 years old. If there are any cool places you know in United States that I missed, let me know! I have already visited majors cities like Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco, Maine, New Orleans, Florida, Las Vegas, New York, and Waikiki. Where do you plan to travel this year?""",b'aquamarine:J Crew sweater;'

I hope you are all excited for FW season. Before the new year, I was planning to go to NYFW, but as it turned out, my aunt from Kazakhstan is planning to travel to Seattle this year. It is happening at the same time as the start of fashion week. I still thought it would be great to create some NYFW outfits to inspire you guys. Since, my first trip to NY ever occurred during winter, I totally know what you need to bring with you. Since January/February are snowy months, make sure to wear warm shoes that will not get wet. A denim skirt or any denim piece is a a must-have in New York. New Yorkers prefer to wear more classy, yet comfortable outfits. That is why I think this striped sweater would work with anything you would wear. Furs coats are always trendy for winter season and, of course, will keep you super toasty. I advise you to definitely bring extra hats, scarfs and mittens, as you never know. Who is going to Fashion Week this year?

But then one day while I was scrolling on ebay I spotted this gorgeous Dolce & Gabbana bag - brand new with tags! The bag was still on the D&G website at the time for over $2,500 but for something that is this trendy, I would never pay that. So when I saw it on ebay with the bid starting at $1,200 I thought, hmmm, interesting. I put it on my watch list to see what it would go for but when the bidding ended, and nobody had made an offer, I knew that it was my chance to make a move. I contacted the seller and offered her $800 plus shipping and she countered at $850! Insert happy dance here! While I know I was supposed to be saving (I'll start tomorrow, promise!) this was just wayyy too good of a deal to pass up. I took the bag to a re-sale shop to have it appraised and they certified that it is authentic. What a steal of a deal! I go totally weak in the knees for sparkles and this little box bag was just what I needed to make my heart incredibly happy. I paired it with a faux fur capelet and a little pink skirt for a look that was perfect for a breakfast date. This was my first handbag purchase on ebay but certainly won't be my last.""",b'white:gianvitto rossi shoes;'

Here I am, wearing cool platform sneakers from Karma Loop. To be honest, it took me a bit to learn how to walk in these shoes. Some of you truly loved them when I featured them on my Snapchat. I love how quickly I can show off all my new goodies. Anyway, I thought this pair of shoes is definitely perfect for a young-themed and comfy outfit.

In order to protect my skin from harmful rays I apply Aveeno's Protect & Hydrate Broad Spectrum SPF 30 lotion. It allows my skin to get a subtle glow without the sunburn.

These photos were taken back in Monterey, but I need to publish these first, and I promise to share our newest cool adventures soon.For this wonderful summer outfit, I picked a white shoulder-off top along with pleated skirt in sky blue color. And the best part of my outfit, I think, is a Poupee de Papier tote bag that compliments my entire get-up. Don\'t you agree? Happy 4th July, guys!

When you plan to travel, you should always think to wear something comfortable, yet stylish. I\'m wearing my Sanctuary Clothing top along with a midi denim skirt. As for accessories, I picked my Poupee de Papier mini bag that can hold my travel camera and 2 phones. Also, I thought that my Lulu*s necklace compliments my entire outfit very nicely.

I could have stayed in town and listened to the footsteps, instead I rolled to where the sun brews the most forgiving air. Nobody else was around at first, just my mum and I. We stood at the jagged edge and heard the wings of birds in the blue sky above us. We kept our distance as a herd of big horn sheep meandered by. It was all too pleasant with the mountains as our backdrop until a school bus of loud tourists pulled in. I came to the mountains to run from the noise, and here I was, suddenly surrounded by the kind of people who feed wild animals and yell when they should whisper. I looked at them with scowling eyes, but nothing in me could stop them from startling the sheep and putting shadows where sunshine ought to be. How is it that even in the most forgiving parts of the world, all it takes is one selfish person to shrink the mountain's size?""",b'dark brown:Western Shop boots;'

Since October last year, I noticed some changes not only in my style but in our living routine as well.

I hope your week started great! I can't believe how quickly time flies. Spring is here! Anyway, if you watched my snapchat, I shared that we bought a Wii U. I was so excited about my new toy, because now I can exercise and have fun. For a couple weeks, I have been visiting physical therapy to treat my back pain, and they showed me this toy. I loved it so much that I had to get one for myself. With the balance board, you're able to see if you're doing exercises correctly. I suppose that's enough of that though! A few days ago, we were shooting my weekend outfit by showing how I styled my new sandals from Nina Shoes. You can't imagine how much I'm in love with them! I have a very old photo of my mom, and I can say for sure that I almost copied her look from the early 90s. What do you think about my retro look?""",b'light brown:farfetch skirt;'

Remember, I promised you to dress my Forever 21 bomber jacket with a mini skirt? Well, here we go! Last week, I got a package from Clarks USA, since I'm their trendsetter. They were nice to send me a pair of their spring collection sneakers. I was so excited to get my sneakers, because I have been recently looking for a new go-to pair. Sadly, my old Stan Smiths have seen better days. My cowley faye pink nubuck sneakers are super soft and light. I'm pretty sure that I can easily walk in them all day long. I will let you know more next time, after we travel somewhere again. Anyway, I thought that it would be fun to create a teen style. Playful poses, pink hues and cute accessories capture the exact image I wanted to show you.""",b'light pink:Forever 21 jacket;'

On the other hand, it can also be\xc2\xa0harsh on sensitive skin or at least this particular one\xc2\xa0turned out to be pretty uncomfortable for my type of skin so much so I decided to wear it only with a collared shirt or turtleneck until I was able to find out a way to avoid any skin contact with the\xc2\xa0harsh\xc2\xa0lapel.
